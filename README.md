# GitPub: federating Git services

GitPub is a decentralized federation protocol based on the W3C's [ActivityPub][ActivityPub], which
extends [ActivityStream 2.0][ActivityStream2]. It provides a server to server API for pull request,
forking and subscription of repositories provided by Git web services (services like Github, Gitlab, 
Gogs, Gitea).

## Collaboration

A specification like this must be agreed upon by at least some of Git web service implementations.
If you are a developer of such a software, please [join our discussion][work-group-discussion] and speak up.
We'll simply add you to the work group.

If you are experienced in writing specifications, you're also welcomed to join the effort.
